## 🎯 The Problem

Developers are forced to choose between:

- ⚡ **Speed** (Antigravity) - Fast but needs review
- 🎯 **Quality** (Claude Code) - Precise but slower

**Why sacrifice one for the other?**

---

## 💡 The Solution

**GravityFlowCode** introduces a revolutionary **two-phase automated pipeline**:

### Phase 1: Rapid Creation ⚡
*Powered by Google Antigravity (Gemini 3)*
- Multiple AI agents work in parallel
- Generate features, tests, and documentation
- Complete in 2-5 minutes

### Phase 2: Surgical Refinement 🎯
*Powered by Claude Code (Opus 4.1)*
- Deep code analysis
- Security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Production-ready output in 1-3 minutes

### Result: 💎
**Enterprise-grade code in 3-8 minutes** (vs 4-8 hours traditional)
